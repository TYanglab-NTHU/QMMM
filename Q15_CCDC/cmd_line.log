Summarize command line parameter
  VerboseFlag = 1 (default or cmd line)
  Input File  = ../TestStructures/chain01.xyz
Clean up old files
Process input file ../TestStructures/chain01.xyz
  process xyz input file (depreciated)
  ../TestStructures/chain01.mol2 (easier to use file format) found
  process mol2 input file (preferred)
  read input file directly into a CSD object
  standarize bonds
  build supplementary OpenBabel object from mol2 file
  compare the molecular geometries of both objects
    the number of atoms 22 in both objects match
    compare geometries line by line ...
    the geometries of both objects match
